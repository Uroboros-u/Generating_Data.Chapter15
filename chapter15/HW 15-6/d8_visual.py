"""Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two
eight-sided dice 1,000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will
look like before you run the simulation, then see if your intuition was correct.
Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your
systemâ€™s capabilities."""
